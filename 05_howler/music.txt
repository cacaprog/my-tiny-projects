Imagine Me
Kirk Franklin

Imagine me loving what I see when the mirror looks at me cause I,
I imagine me
In a place of no insecurities and I'm finally happy cause
I imagine me
Letting go of all of the ones who hurt me cause they never did deserve me
Can You imagine me?
Saying no to thoughts that try to control me, remembering all You told me
Lord, can You imagine me?

Over what my momma said, hear from what my daddy did and
I wanna live and not read that page again

Imagine me
Being free
Trusting you totally
Finally I can imagine me
I admit it was hard to see You being in love with someone like me
Finally I can imagine me

Being strong and not letting people break me down
You won't get that joy this time around
Can You imagine me?
In a world where nobody has to be afraid because of Your love it's gone away
Can You imagine me?
Letting go of my past and glad I have another chance and hard to dance cause
I don't have to read that page again

This song is dedicated to people like me those that struggle with insecurities, Acceptance and even self esteem.
You never felt pretty enough,
You never felt good enough but
Imagine God whispering in your ear letting you know,
That everything that is happening it's now...

Gone, gone, its' gone, all gone
